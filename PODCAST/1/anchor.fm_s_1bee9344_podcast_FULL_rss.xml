			<title><![CDATA[Base: Coinbase's New Layer 2 Kicks Off]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jesse Pollak is the creator of Base, which is a Layer 2 scaling solution from Coinbase that launched last week. </p>
<p>Base has quickly become a trending topic this summer, attracting more than $200M of value in its short life. Coinbase is the world’s second-largest crypto centralized exchange by volume, and now it’s moving to the on-chain world, so it’s worth watching. </p>
<p>In our conversation, we dive into the origin story of Base, why opt for a Layer 2 and not start a new Layer 1, why go for Optimistic rollups, how Base is unique in the already crowded Layer 2 space, their decentralization road map and more. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Revealing ONE Secret for Crypto Adoption: Art Blocks Founder Erick Calderon]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are joined by Erick Calderon, founder of Art Blocks. You may also know him as Snowfro. Erick is not only a talented artist but also a tech innovator and entrepreneur who has redefined the limits of artistic expression in the digital era. Today we get into how Art Blocks fosters creativity and community via the platform, how they differ from other projects, Erick&#39;s views on why you should even buy art in the first place, as well as his passion for generative art and decentralization. We also get into his views on the NFT market fluctuations and he shares a bit about the community of curators that are curating art on Art Blocks and how you can get involved there. But first, Erick will begin by telling us about his crypto origin story and early involvement in the Crypto Punks community.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nicolas Liochon is the Global Lead for Linea, which is a new zkEVM rollup by Consensys. Rollups play a crucial role in scaling Ethereum as they reduce computational load on the main network by processing transactions off-chain. The two prominent rollups currently available on Ethereum are ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups, and Linea is the latest ZK Rollup to launch. </p>
<p>In our conversation, we will explore how Linea sets itself apart in the already highly competitive Ethereum Layer 2 landscape. But first, we will begin our conversation with an introduction to Linea.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ethereum is "Terrifyingly" Centralized but there's a way out, ether.fi founder says ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mike Silagadze is the founder and CEO of ether.fi, which is a new player in ethereum staking space, which allows stakers to control their keys while delegating their stake. A reminder that Ethereum now runs on Proof of Stake, which requires users to deposit, or stake, their ETH. Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade introduced the ability for early stakers to withdraw their ETH, which made Ethereum staking and the projects around it one of the hottest themes of crypto this year. Tokens that function as a receipt of staked ETH, called Liquid Staking Tokens, grew in popularity, as did concerns about centralization. We will begin our conversation with an introduction to ether.fi, followed by their differentiation in the already competitive liquid staking sphere.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we&#39;re joined by Coinbase&#39;s head of cryptography, Yehuda Lindell. He has big news to share as Coinbase just released WaaS which is an MPC wallet. Some are calling this one of the most exciting products from Coinbase yet. Yehuda has an impressive track record. He&#39;s a former professor and the former CEO of Unbound Tech, a cybersecurity company specializing in privacy and key management solutions. Unbound Tech, the company Yehuda co-founded, was acquired by Coinbase. Yehuda leads the cryptography team at Coinbase, driving innovation in the field of secure computation and increased privacy and data security. On today&#39;s podcast, we dive into the cryptography team at Coinbase, the new innovative wallet that might just be the key to mass adoption for crypto, bringing self-custody to the masses where we&#39;re expecting tech giants to jump on this new wallet opportunity, how WaaS compares to holding crypto on exchanges and Multisigs, Coinbase Self-Custody and beyond. We also get into Yehuda’s advice for aspiring cryptographers and so much more. But first, Yehuda tells us what he&#39;s focused on inside of Coinbase.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Goldfinch Founders Talk Triple-Digit Growth and UX Upgrades in DeFi]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are joined by the <strong>cofounding forces behind Goldfinch, Blake West and Mike Sall.</strong> They share with us about what they learned from over 70 user interviews from everyone from Blackrock, Apollo to retired nurses, as well as their excitement around the user experience improvements for the entire Web3 and crypto space and how that UX and UI improvement will impact the Goldfinch Protocol. They also dive into how they saw 162% year-over-year growth in 2022 with no defaults. Blake and Mike give us insight into their thoughts on how crypto will reshape the global economy, expanding access to capital around the world and what they&#39;re building to make that possible. But first they give us the TL;DR of Goldfinch as well as what they&#39;re both focused on.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Monahan is the founder of MyCrypto, an Ethereum wallet, and today she’s helping build MetaMask. As part of her job, she has become a full-time blockchain detective. She’s also a character in my book, The Infinite Machine! Taylor is the first one who alerted us to the fact that in the past several months, a mysterious hack has taken over crypto wallets, draining $10 million worth of ether from OGs in the space. We begin our conversation with Taylor breaking down the hack from the beginning and also the latest in this saga. Then we go over her own, long history in the space, she gives risk management advice for crypto users and developers, and ponders some deep questions on whether code is law and whether DeFi should really be immutable.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>🙏 Thanking our podcast sponsor:</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today we are joined by the all-around dev phenomenon Nader Dabit. Nader has become a household name across the developer community with his combination of to-the-point tutorials, live coding demos and interviews focused on modern web development, Web 3, AI, cloud computing and more. He&amp;#39;s always learning and experimenting in public. Nader is currently the Director of Dev Relations at Aave/Lens. Today, he&amp;#39;ll get to do some details behind his journey into Web 3 starting with The Graph, decentralized social media, the devs building on the Lens Protocol, Lens infrastructure and he&amp;#39;ll give us a mini deep dive into gasless transactions via Lens. But first, Nader tells us about what it was like being early to AWS before he made his switch into Web 3 full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🙏 Thanking our podcast sponsors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are joined by the ma behind ENS - the Ethereum Name Service. Since we last chatted with Nick in 2021, he has made ENS a household name across the crypto industry and beyond. Nick and I get into the details behind the ENS roadmap, including the latest V3 announcement, what it was like for Nick to go from Google to the Ethereum Foundation to founding ENS, and the inside scoop on last year&#39;s drama with Brantly and the current culture at ENS and so much more. But first, Nick is going to tell us the founding story of ENS and how he managed to go from Google to Ethereum to founding ENS.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant podcast, Tegan Kline hosts Jesse Pollak, senior director of Engineering at Coinbase, Eva Beylin, the director of the Graph Foundation, and Ben Jones, the director of the Optimism Foundation, to give us a deep dive into the launch of Base, Coinbase's recently-launched Layer 2 blockchain.</p>
<p>Base is an Ethereum Layer two that offers a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly way for anyone anywhere to build decentralized applications.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Synthetix, DeFi Summer 2, FTX, 3AC and Crystal Meth with Crypto OG Kain Warwick]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, Tegan Kline chats with Kain Warwick, crypto OG and founder of Synthetix.</p>
<p>Synthetix is a new financial primitive enabling the creation of synthetic assets, offering unique derivatives and exposure to real-world assets on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we dive into what's next for Synthetix with the latest V3 launch, and what will cause the next big leg up in DeFi - what we’re calling DeFi Summer 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We go on to discuss the differentiation between different perpetual products that exist in crypto, and how Synthetix made the decision to launch on a Layer 2 so quickly and burn all bridges behind them. And it gets pretty spicy with some tea on FTX and 3AC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into it, Kain tells us what he's been up to since we last spoke to him about what it takes to scale Ethereum.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[DeFi, Fantom, Regulations, and the Challenges Of Being a Crypto Celebrity with Andre Cronje]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, Camila Russo chats with Andre Cronje, the co-founder of Fantom, a Layer 1 blockchain, and also the founder of Yearn Finance, one of the first yield aggregators in DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andre is certainly a key figure in the DeFi space who, at times, has been seen as a rockstar, and also been criticized for his controversial takes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We start by talking about Andre’s backstory: How did he get into crypto in the first place, and why did he decide to build in DeFi?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Tekin Salimi on Managing $125M Through A DAO]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak with Tekin Salimi, the founder of dao5, a Web 3 investment fund founded last year. Tekin was previously at Polychain Capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dao5 is an experimental cryptocurrency investment fund with plans to convert into a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dive into the biggest DAO drama from the last year, why Tekin is so bullish and excited about DAOs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also discuss Tekin's investment thesis while he was at Polychain, his switch to focus mostly on the Ethereum ecosystem at dao5, Web 3 infrastructure, NFTs, regulations, his thoughts on FTX, and so much more.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Notorious Threadooor Adam Cochran Explains Crypto Shopping and Shorting List]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak with Adam Cochran, an investor at Cinneamhain Ventures, who's probably most known for his extensive Twitter threads.</p>
<p>We kick off our conversation by asking Adam if he expected to turn into a meme in the crypto community for his long-winded tweets.</p>
<p>The primary driver behind crypto this year has been traditional macro markets. Crypto markets have been at the mercy of inflation and rising interest rates and the FED recently raised interest rates by half a point. Adam talks about where he thinks rates and inflation are headed and how will that impact crypto.</p>
<p>The coins mentioned on Adam’s shopping list from December 2021 have approximately lost 80% of their value this year. For comparison, Bitcoin has dropped 60%. We talk about the thesis behind the list and whether he’s changing it for next year. &nbsp;Adam says that he adjusted to the market conditions and had been shorting throughout the year, compensating for some of his long positions.</p>
<p>Finally, Adam shares some trade ideas for 2023.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[BitGo's Mike Belshe on What's Next for WBTC & Crypto Custodians]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak with Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, a digital asset custodian, wallet, and issuer of wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).</p>
<p>We start our conversation with an overview of BitGo and Mike's crypto journey.</p>
<p>Wrapped Bitcoin is the most successful representation of Bitcoin on Ethereum. There’s about 200K Bitcoin in BitGo's custody, which is the equivalent of $3.4B. WBTC is an important piece of the ecosystem as it enables Bitcoin holders to interact with DeFi. We dive into the recent selloff that saw WBTC lose its peg to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In the final part of our conversation, we discuss the role of custodians in the crypto space. Especially after what happened this year with FTX and various other centralized entities, crypto has been given a wake-up call to bring transparency and disclosures to CeFi. We explore the biggest lessons we can take away from this year.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Arweave's Sam Williams on Storing Files On-Chain for Eternity]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak with Sam Williams, the co-founder and CEO of Arweave, a 'collectively owned hard drive' that enables users to store data, applications, and documents on-chain, forever.</p>
<p>We start by learning about Sam's crypto journey, from discovering Bitcoin in 2010 and going on to invest in the Ethereum ICO and finally, starting Arweave.</p>
<p>Sam thinks we're seeing a renewed focus on decentralization as the debate over censoring transactions continues. He believes it's essential to keep a neutral historical record that future generations can learn from.</p>
<p>We go on to dive into the varied use cases of Arweave, what Sam says to those that say Arweave might be too expensive to store certain files, how Arweave is used to store NFTs so that they can live forever, and how you can earn money with Arweave.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Filecoin's Juan Benet on Upgrading the Heart of The Internet with Blockchains]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak with Juan Benet, the founder of Protocol Labs and the inventor of the InterPlanetary File System.</p>
<p>Juan is also the creator of Filecoin, a storage network incentivized by crypto. Both of Juan’s ventures are hugely ambitious as they are in direct competition with the basic rails of the internet, with protocols such as HTTP and data giants like AWS. We begin our conversation with Juan explaining what led him to start IPFS and Filecoin.</p>
<p>Juan points out that all of the layers of the internet that run below the application layer, rely on trust. He believes that the promise of web3 is to be able to upgrade the whole stack with trust-minimized public verifiability primitives.</p>
<p>One of the key innovations of IPFS is in data addressing, which increases the efficiency of data fetching. But there’s more to IPFS than just this, and we talk about some of the other features of IPFS.</p>
<p>Juan says universities would be a good next step to expand the user base of Filecoin since they deal with large amounts of data and run intensive computations. We go on to discuss Filecoin's plans to encourage the adoption of its technology beyond web3 users.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Saga's Bogdan Alexandrescu on Making Web3 More Accessible to Builders]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, Tegan Kline speaks with Bogdan Alexandrescu, co-founder and VP of Engineering at SAGA.</p>
<p>SAGA is focused on lowering the barrier of entry for building in Web3 so that developers can spin up a blockchain in a single click, and the company places emphasis on the metaverse.</p>
<p>In this conversation, we dive deep into Bogdan’s departure from Apple after six years to work full-time in crypto, any advice that he has for anyone looking to make a similar switch, what the metaverse is, more about SAGA, and the current innovator program they’re running.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Onyx's Tyrone Lobban Takes Us Behind the Scenes of JP Morgan's First DeFi Trade]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Tyrone Lobban, the head of blockchain at JPMorgan’s Onyx, a business unit focused on digital assets.</p>
<p>In the craziness of the past couple weeks, it’s easy to overlook or forget good news and positive developments. JP Morgan recently made history by becoming the first major bank to execute a live DeFi trade. The trade involved tokenized forex and government bonds and it all happened on the Polygon blockchain.</p>
<p>In our conversation, we dive into the details of the trade and discuss the implications of major banks like JP Morgan and the rest of TradFi using DeFi, and start by getting a better understanding of Onyx.</p>
<p>JP Morgan’s first DeFi transaction took place on 2 November 2022 and was facilitated by Project Guardian, a pilot initiative of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The trade had a lot of moving pieces and was rather complex. Tyrone takes us behind the scenes and walks us through the steps taken to ensure adherence to KYC/AML standards.</p>
<p>Due to regulatory and privacy concerns, JPMorgan is currently running its DeFi experiments on a permissioned sidechain. We discuss the likelihood of a shift from private infrastructure to a public blockchain.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Polygon's Hamzah Khan Wants to Make DeFi More Accessible Than Running Water]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Hamzah Khan, Head of Defi at Polygon. Polygon is one of the biggest players in DeFi with $1.5B in TVL and in the blockchain space in general. Hamzah begins by giving us a brief overview of the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite the bear market, Polygon has been forging high-profile NFT partnerships with companies like Instagram and Reddit. Its network was also used by JP Morgan’s Onyx unit to conduct the first interbank on-chain forex swap and was chosen by Robinhood to debut its Web3 wallet. We dive into the details of these partnerships with Hamzah.</p>
<p>Unlike its sidechain counterpart, Polygon zkEVM will be directly built on Ethereum to serve as a Layer 2. Hamzah goes on to explain the main differences between the two scaling solutions and breaks down the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<p>And finally, Hamzah shares his insights into the DeFi ecosystem on Polygon —where most of the activity happens and the innovations he’s excited about.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[🎙️Offchain Labs' A.J. Warner on Making Arbitrum the Leading Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with A.J. Warner, the Chief Strategy Officer at Offchain Labs, the builders of Arbitrum, one of the leading scaling solutions for Ethereum using Optimistic Rollups. We also welcome Tegan Kline, the co-founder of Edge Node, the initial team behind The Graph.</p>
<p>The Defiant’s Camila Russo and Tegan are co-hosting the podcast for the first time. Going forward, they will record shows together, and Tegan will also have her own Defiant podcast episodes.</p>
<p>Scaling is now a hot topic on Ethereum and throughout the blockchain ecosystem, as all of our listeners are likely aware. According to L2Beat, Arbitrum has nearly $2.7B in total value locked. AJ goes on to explain the dapps and protocols building on Arbitrum and how they’ve managed to make Arbitrum the leading destination among Layer 2s.</p>
<p>Arbitrum is one of the few scaling solutions that doesn't nod to the underlying technology it uses in its name. As AJ mentioned, their goal is to scale Ethereum without being a proponent of any scaling technology. Does this mean Arbitrum will have a zero-knowledge (ZK) component in the future?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Delphi Labs' Gabriel Shapiro on How 100% of DeFi Could Become Illegal]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs and a member of the LeXpunK group of crypto lawyers. He’s regarded as one of the most prominent voices on regulation in the crypto space, which has lately been a major point of discussion.</p>
<p>Recent developments include the latest draft of the DCCPA bill, Sam Bankman Fried’s industry standards <a href="https://thedefiant.io/defi-criticizes-sam-bankman-fried" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>, the CFTC charging <a href="https://thedefiant.io/cftc-sues-dao" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ooki DAO</a>, and the Tornado Cash <a href="https://thedefiant.io/a-violation-on-free-speech-jake-chervinsky-on-tornado-cash-and-the-future-of-legislation-in-crypto" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sanctions</a>. We begin our conversation with Gabriel sharing his thoughts on the current state of the crypto regulatory landscape in the U.S.</p>
<p>There are currently seven government bodies that govern crypto in the US. These are the SEC, CFTC, CFPB, IRS, FinCEN, OFAC, and Congress. We discuss how setting an overarching framework within which these bodies can operate could prevent them from regulating their own corners of the market.</p>
<p>In comparison to other DeFi projects that offer similar services, Ooki DAO is a relatively small player. With the CFTC coming after Ooki DAO, we explore the potential implications for the biggest players in the space like Aave and Compound.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[a16z's Ali Yahya Says We’ve Entered The Golden Era Of Blockchain Applications]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Ali Yahya, General Partner at a16z, also known as Andreessen Horowitz. a16z is an investment giant - they’ve raised $6.7B between their crypto funds in the last two years and are the largest crypto-dedicated fund in the world.</p>
<p>We start by discussing how a16z got its start in crypto - their first investment, where they channelled their focus, and how they evolved to where they are today.</p>
<p>According to Ali, we’re entering the Golden Age of blockchain applications. We talk about how building in the middle of the bear market is laying the foundation for the next bull run.</p>
<p>Ali notes several key developments he’s observing in blockchain that span from networking to usability at the application layer. These include innovations in privacy, programming languages, proof-of-stake, consensus algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, scalability and interoperability.</p>
<p>An important takeaway from our conversation is that Ali believes in a future of multiple blockchains that coexist with each chain serving a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Will we see today’s biggest players maintain their dominance in the future? Or are the next generation of blockchains yet to launch?</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Ali Yahya, General Partner at a16z, also known as Andreessen Horowitz. a16z is an investment giant - they’ve raised $6.7B between their crypto funds in the last two years and are the largest crypto-dedicated fund in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by discussing how a16z got its start in crypto - their first investment, where they channelled their focus, and how they evolved to where they are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ali, we’re entering the Golden Age of blockchain applications. We talk about how building in the middle of the bear market is laying the foundation for the next bull run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali notes several key developments he’s observing in blockchain that span from networking to usability at the application layer. These include innovations in privacy, programming languages, proof-of-stake, consensus algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, scalability and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important takeaway from our conversation is that Ali believes in a future of multiple blockchains that coexist with each chain serving a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we see today’s biggest players maintain their dominance in the future? Or are the next generation of blockchains yet to launch?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[🎙️Friends with Benefits' Alex Zhang on Building Web3 Communities That Endure]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s Defiant Podcast is from a conversation I had with Alex Zhang at the Unfinished Live conference. Alex is the mayor of Friend with Benefits, or FWB, a prominent DAO of creatives.</p>
<p>Friends with Benefits started as an experiment when its founder minted and airdropped the FWB token to an early community. &nbsp;FWB holders gained access to private chat groups on Discord. &nbsp;From there, it developed into a community of thousands of members, live events and even proprietary software. &nbsp;Alex explains the evolution and growth of Friends with Benefits.</p>
<p>A common criticism of Web3 is that it over-financializes communities and social media. To join Friends with Benefits, a user must hold 75 FWB in their Ethereum wallet. &nbsp;&nbsp;At its peak, membership would have set you back $14,000. At current prices, it costs roughly $600, which can still be considered a prohibitive price for most people. Alex shares his thoughts on this exclusionary feature of Web3.</p>
<p>In the past two years, we’ve seen a boom in Web3 communities sprouting from DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs. &nbsp;&nbsp;As we’re still in an experimental phase in this regard, meaning there are no strict rules and practices, we discuss how Alex finds running a DAO in this environment, given the less hierarchical and structureless nature found in Web3 communities.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Wintermute's David Micley Says Institutional Investors Are Here To Stay]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with <strong>David Micley</strong>, the business development director at Wintermute, one of the largest digital asset market makers in the world.</p>
<p>With all the macro headwinds pummeling markets, from the energy crisis in Europe, global inflation, and war in Ukraine, to the recent turmoil with Credit Suisse, we can’t help but feel a sense of deja vu about the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p><strong>David believes we’re just in the first inning of what could be a multi-year crypto winter.</strong></p>
<p>But he’s seeing that institutional investors are still signing up to trade with Wintermute’s OTC desk, which indicates that large players are still committed to the space this time around.</p>
<p>David also shares his views on the venture side of crypto. &nbsp;&nbsp;He believes some of the biggest bets right now are blockchain infrastructure plays. With funding getting harder to come by for crypto startups, he provides insights on where he sees the space evolving.</p>
<p>Finally, we discuss the <a href="https://thedefiant.io/wintermute-hacked-160m" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$160M hack</a> that Wintermute suffered recently and the lessons learned.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Starkware Founders: Ethereum Could Surpass Visa's Transaction Speeds Within Months]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Uri Kolodny and Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founders of Starkware, one of the leading Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum.</p>
<p>Post Merge, Ethereum continues to rely on scaling solutions like Starkware and will continue to do so, according to the network’s long-term roadmap.</p>
<p>Visa processes 1700 transactions per second, and that number is often quoted as the Holy Grail for a blockchain to become a viable settlement layer for finance. They explain how that can be achieved with the help of Starkware.</p>
<p>In the early stages of building Starkware, Uri and Eli had decided not to launch a token. After two years of running Starkware and StarkNet being in alpha, is a STARK token on the horizon?</p>
<p>Currently, Starkware is solely used for scaling Ethereum. We talk about Uri and Eli’s plans to expand Starkware’s services to other Layer 1s.</p>
<p>Finally, we discuss the future of scaling solutions, decentralized applications, DeFi, NFTs, and more.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[ConsenSys' Ben Edgington On The Future Of Ethereum After The Merge]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Ben Edgington, the product owner of Teku, an Ethereum 2.0 client being developed at Consensys.</p>
<p>It’s been a week since Ethereum switched from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Ben has been heavily involved in the process. We start our conversation by taking a look at the aftermath of the Merge.</p>
<p>One of the biggest criticisms of The Merge was that Ethereum under PoS would become centralized. Proof-of-stake enables individuals to delegate their ETH to entities that stake on their behalf, as running a node might be inconvenient or infeasible. We discuss how roughly half of the staked Ether is held by a handful of validators and what Ben thinks about this.</p>
<p>Finally, Ben shares his thoughts on the future of Ethereum and what comes next, now that the Merge is complete.</p>
<p>🙏 Thanking our podcast sponsors:</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Liquity's Robert Lauko On Censorship And Building A Fully Decentralized Stablecoin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast we speak with Robert Lauko, founder &amp; head of research at Liquity, an overcollateralized DeFi lending protocol and issuer of the LUSD stablecoin.</p>
<p>Following the fallout from CeFi services such as <a href="https://thedefiant.io/voyager-halts-withdrawals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Voyager</a>, <a href="https://thedefiant.io/ftx-agrees-to-buy-blockfi" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BlockFi</a>, and <a href="https://thedefiant.io/crypto-lender-celsius-files-for-bankruptcy-protection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Celsius</a>, the focus has shifted back to the core values of decentralization, which Liquity tries to apply to the fullest: LUSD is backed purely by Ether and Liquity is governance-free and has no centralized frontend.</p>
<p>Crypto mixer Tornado Cash was <a href="https://thedefiant.io/tornado-cash-us-sanctions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recently sanctioned</a> by the US Department of the Treasury together with addresses that interacted with the protocol. &nbsp;&nbsp;This prompted other DeFi protocols such as Aave and dYdX to <a href="https://thedefiant.io/defi-bans-tornado-addresses" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">blacklist those addresses</a> in a bid to minimize legal risk. &nbsp;Robert discusses how DeFi projects can deal with censorship.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Zcash's Zooko Says Crypto Users Must Have The Choice To Transact Privately]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant podcast we speak to Zooko, the founder of &nbsp;Zcash.</p>
<p>Privacy remains one of the hottest issues in crypto after the U.S. Treasury’s recent move to sanction Tornado Cash. Zooko believes the ability to consent to what information is made public is more about freedom than privacy and he thinks that eventually, this will be expected in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>We explore what a private transaction using ZEC actually looks like, with shielded addresses visible only to the sender and receiver.</p>
<p>Finally, Zooko talks about The Electric Coin Company’s future plans, which include moving Zcash from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and a standalone wallet.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on The Defiant Podcast, we speak Will Warren, founder and CEO of 0x labs, one of the oldest and largest decentralized exchanges. &nbsp;0x API is currently the 5th largest DEX by trading volume but is structurally different from other DEXs as it aggregates liquidity from multiple venues.</p>
<p>We talk about the effect this bear market has had on the DEX ecosystem and how sliding prices have affected DEX volumes in 2022.</p>
<p>We discuss the evolution of DEXs, having seen some massive innovations such as concentrated liquidity with Uniswap V3. Will goes on to talk about the major impact that miner-extractable value (MEV) has had on the DEX sector.</p>
<p>Finally, Will talks about 0x’s vision to see a world where all forms of value are tokenized on public blockchains, from fiat currencies, stocks and bonds, to video game items and airline miles.</p>

<p>We dive into UMA's plans for its 2.0 release, the risks posed by centralized cross-chain bridges and Outcome Finance, an upcoming brand that will encompass all the DAO tooling that the UMA team has been building.</p>

Justin is a researcher for the Ethereum foundation.

We go into what the next steps are before this change happens, how exactly it will be executed, and what the risks are. Last week, right after we recorded this interview, fellow researcher Tim Beiko suggested the switch would happen in September.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[ Tezos Co-Founder Arthur Breitman Looks Forward To No-hype Crypto Shining Through]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on the Defiant Podcast we speak to Arthur Breitman, the co-founder of Tezos. Created together with his wife Kathleen way back in 2014, Tezos mainnet was launched in 2018 as a proof of stake chain with smart contracts, a combo that has now become the industry standard. They were very much ahead of their time.</p>
<p>Yet, Tezos has been slower to pick up than other Layer 1s such as Ethereum &amp; Solana. &nbsp;We discuss its upcoming upgrades and roadmap, and how Arthur sees a deeper DeFi and NFT ecosystem evolving on the network. He argues that with the hype and vanity metrics of the bull run fading away, Tezos approach of what he considers is more thoughtful building, will shine through.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Defiant Podcast we speak to Arthur Breitman, the co-founder of Tezos. Created together with his wife Kathleen way back in 2014, Tezos mainnet was launched in 2018 as a proof of stake chain with smart contracts, a combo that has now become the industry standard. They were very much ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Tezos has been slower to pick up than other Layer 1s such as Ethereum &amp;amp; Solana. &amp;nbsp;We discuss its upcoming upgrades and roadmap, and how Arthur sees a deeper DeFi and NFT ecosystem evolving on the network. He argues that with the hype and vanity metrics of the bull run fading away, Tezos approach of what he considers is more thoughtful building, will shine through.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Ex SushiSwap CTOJoseph Delong on Why DAOs Fail]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/josephdelong" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Joseph Delong</a> is the former CTO of SushiSwap, one of the biggest decentralized exchanges, and the founder of Astaria, a recently created NFT lending protocol. Joseph has been heavily involved in building and managing DAOs. With the recent controversial proposals surfacing on MakerDAO and Lido, we are once again reminded of the importance of DAO governance. We begin by talking about Joseph’s analogy on what would happen if a lemonade stand was run by a DAO and reflect on some of the DAO experiments that occurred over the last couple of years.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/yoniassia" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Yoni Assia</strong></a> is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.etoro.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>eToro</strong></a>, one of the most successful crypto and stock buying apps with over 27 million users in more than 100 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally founded in 2007, it was one of the pioneering companies to incorporate crypto as early as 2013. Yoni speaks about what led to being so early and where the idea for Etoro stemmed from. He also dives into the importance of the user experience in creating a mainstream crypto trading app, and how including a social aspect to the product early on helped in accelerating growth.</p>
<p>We talked about the next phase for eToro and the role NFTs and DeFi will play in the platform, as he looks to integrate both. Yoni is convinced finance will become increasingly digital, and believes eToro’s role is to help investors diversify their holdings. He sees a change in investment attitudes as the younger generation is interested in taking a more active role with their assets, and trading is becoming a more social experience. Finally, we talk about some of the lessons he has learned about entrepreneurship and taking big risks.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Terra Post Mortem and Future with Kevin Zhou, One of the Few Investors Who Predicted the Crash]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Galois_Capital" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Kevin Zhou</strong></a> is the founder of crypto quant fund, Galois Capital and former head of trading at Kraken. Last week, Terra, one of the most prominent ecosystems in crypto, effectively disintegrated in days. Its native token Luna had over $40 B in market cap at its peak, and nearly all of it was wiped out while UST, which was supposed to be a stablecoin worth $1 crashed. It was a historical moment in crypto as never before had a project that big, crashed so hard, so quickly. Kevin was one of the few who saw it coming and predicted the fall just a couple of months ago. In this interview, he talks about the red flags that helped him get to that conclusion. We also talk about whether there’s any hope for algorithmic stablecoins and explore potential alternatives for this type of asset. &nbsp;Kevin discusses the ripple effects we’re already seeing in crypto and more broadly, what to expect for the coming bear market.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Buenos Aires City Innovation Chief Talks Crypto Tax Payments and How Web3 will Revolutionize Democracy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week we speak to <a href="https://twitter.com/fernandezdiego" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Diego Fernandez</a>, the secretary of innovation and digital transformation for the city of Buenos Aires. Recently, news broke that Buenos Aires will be taking tax payments via crypto, an initiative that Diego helped shape. We talk about what this means for residents of the city and how it works in practice. Diego also addressed critics’ response to the measure, who questioned why Argentines would spend crypto instead of holding it as a store of value. Diego dives into the city’s broader plans with crypto, including how it wants to leverage the tools and data at its disposal to build a blockchain-based identity system.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BoredElonMusk</a> is one of the most prominent Twitter personalities in the crypto space with over 1.7M followers at the time of recording. With decades of online gaming experience, he is now taking his skills offline with his new venture, Bored Box, a curation platform for blockchain games. BoredElon grew his Twitter profile by consistently tweeting wacky but relatable inventions. We talk about how he built out his brand on Twitter, at what point he was able to leverage and monetize his audience, and also his take on the OG Elon’s move to try to buy the social media platform. We also get into how he was able to transition to crypto, first through NFT artist collabs, next by investing in startups and now building his own project.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Prominent Academic Fabian Schär Says Crypto Regulation Should Happen Only at On/Off-Ramps and Ditch Consumer Protection]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chainomics?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fabian Schär</a> is one of the most prominent academics focusing on blockchains and specifically DeFi. He has a great deal of experience speaking with regulators and studying different laws and frameworks being applied to crypto. He argues regulators should not be using old laws to regulate new tech. He also says regulation should happen at the off and on-ramp level, and at individual businesses, but not in the non-custodial world of on-chain transactions. Fabian has the somewhat controversial opinion that regultaros should ditch consumer protection as a goal all together, and trust that each individual should be free to decide what to do with their money, and take responsibility for their decisions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jillrgunter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Jill Gunter</strong></a> is the co-founder and chief strategy officer at scaling solution <a href="https://twitter.com/EspressoSys" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Espresso Systems</a> and a venture partner at Slow Ventures. She became interested in Bitcoin via her experience with Latin American markets — which is somewhat of a pattern in the space. She was a debt trader at Goldman Sachs, focusing on Argentina and Venezuelan bonds, and saw crypto’s potential to help those in corrupt or repressive regimes. She continued exploring how crypto can help skirt currency controls and enable more global and efficient markets, and we discuss how those themes are playing out right now in the war in Ukraine. We talk about how Jill went from Wall Street to crypto, and from VC to founder. Her latest venture is Espresso Systems, which aims to bring scalability and privacy to web3.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Making Magic - A Defiant Love Story with Robin Schmidt & Alp Gasimov]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We have a special podcast episode this week — a live conversation between Defiant founder Camila, our head of video <a href="https://twitter.com/IamSuperMassive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Robin</a>, and our editor <a href="https://twitter.com/alpGasimov" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Alp</a>, recorded directly from The Defiant’s video studio in the Netherlands. Robin and Alp were one of the very first team members working with Camila in making the best DeFi and web3 content out there. In this episode we hear their story, how they came to work together and what moves them. We also go behind the scenes on their intense production process and schedule. Together with Camila, they also try to make sense of the latest drivers behind the crypto market, including the war in Ukraine, last year’s massive bull run and the recent volatility.</p>

Together with Camila, they also try to make sense of the latest drivers behind the crypto market, including the war in Ukraine, last year’s massive bull run and the recent volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/seiff">Ken Seiff</a> is the managing partner of <a href="https://blockchange.vc/">Blockchange Ventures</a>, one of the longest-standing venture funds focusing on early-stage blockchain startups. One of his very first forays into crypto was as one of the investors in Ethereum’s token sale, as I describe in my book, The Infinite Machine. He went on to focus on various other Layer 1s at Blockchange, investing in Polkadot, Solana, Near and Flow, among others. Ken’s investments look to capture not just the potential value of the venture itself, but the overall growth of a space that is still in its infancy, and his bet is that taking exposure at the base protocol layer is the best way to do that.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/feindura"><strong>Fabian Vogelsteller</strong></a> is a Blockchain veteran who was part of the Ethereum community in its very early days. He helped shape the Ethereum space, building an ETH Wallet and a web3 Browser, which were one of the first of their kind. Fabian is the co-founder of the Lukso blockchain and together with Vitalik Buterin, created the ERC-20 standard, a foundational building block for Ethereum. The next standard Fabian is excited about is ERC725, which he says will help introduce blockchain-based profiles as opposed to accounts.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode of The Defiant podcast, we speak to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurashin/&quot;&gt;Laura Shin&lt;/a&gt;, the former senior editor at Forbes and host of the popular podcast Unchained, about her new book ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/laura-shin/the-cryptopians/9781541763012/?lens=publicaffairs&quot;&gt;The Cryptopians&lt;/a&gt;: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze.’ In Cryptopians, Laura may have solved Ethereum’s biggest mystery; the identity of the DAO hacker. In this interview, she goes into the backstory of how she came up with the most credible suspect to date.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EdanYago">Edan Yago</a> is a co-founder of <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/">Sovryn</a>, a Bitcoin-based lending protocol. He’s maybe the first Bitcoin builder we have had on our show and that’s because DeFi on the first blockchain network has been slow to pick up — but Edan says that’s about to change. Ethereum and other smart contracts platforms have evolved over time with use cases like tokens, DAO’s and NFTs flourishing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has mainly looked from the sidelines.

			<title><![CDATA[Vitalik Buterin on Building a Base Layer for the Global Economy Without Compromising on Decentralization]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin"><strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong></a> wrote the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> white paper when he was just 19. His aim was simple yet comprehensive, to create a ‘world computer’ that was designed to be a flexible base layer for all online applications without the need of any third party. Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has become the most active and largest smart contracts platform, but has it achieved the ‘world computer’ goal?</p>
<p>Vitalik says yes and no. In the interview, it’s clear that to him, it’s almost a given that Ethereum will achieve this goal. The bigger concern is not whether the network becomes a settlement layer and decentralized engine for smart contracts used globally, but how much value and impact applications running on top of it will bring.</p>

The primary source of revenue for any non-profit organization is donations, but relying on individuals giving voluntarily can limit their impact, Griff says. He argues a system that better aligns incentives can allow non-profits to have a much larger role in society, potentially even stepping in where local governments are failing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/">Emin Gun Sirer</a> first came on The Defiant in May 2020, Avalanche was not even on mainnet yet. Since then, it has risen to become one of the leading smart contract networks, while the AVAX token has risen over 7x in the last 12 months. We talk about how the project got here and how it wants to create a path for faster and more scalable decentralized network, amid heavy competition from other Layer 1 blockchains.</p>
<p>Emin makes the case for Avalache’s novel consensus mechanism, paired with subnets with their own virtual machines, and he also has scathing criticism for Ethereum and other Layer 2 scaling solutions. To him, once a platform starts building Layer 2s, it means they’ve run out of ideas on how to make a good Layer 1. We also discuss the big picture goal for Avalanche; Bitcoin centers around digital gold, Ethereum strives to create the world computer, and Avalanche wants to digitize all assets. If it's on a balance sheet, Emin says, it can be on a blockchain, and we discuss what it will take for it to get there.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/&quot;&gt;Emin Gun Sirer&lt;/a&gt; first came on The Defiant in May 2020, Avalanche was not even on mainnet yet. Since then, it has risen to become one of the leading smart contract networks, while the AVAX token has risen over 7x in the last 12 months. We talk about how the project got here and how it wants to create a path for faster and more scalable decentralized network, amid heavy competition from other Layer 1 blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emin makes the case for Avalache’s novel consensus mechanism, paired with subnets with their own virtual machines, and he also has scathing criticism for Ethereum and other Layer 2 scaling solutions. To him, once a platform starts building Layer 2s, it means they’ve run out of ideas on how to make a good Layer 1. We also discuss the big picture goal for Avalanche; Bitcoin centers around digital gold, Ethereum strives to create the world computer, and Avalanche wants to digitize all assets. If it&apos;s on a balance sheet, Emin says, it can be on a blockchain, and we discuss what it will take for it to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Synthetix's Kain Warwick: What it Takes to Scale an Ethereum DeFi Protocol]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we sit with <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne">Kain Warwick</a>, DeFi OG and founder of <a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a>. In some ways, last year wasn’t a great one for the synthetic assets protocol. As many DeFi projects boomed, SNX’s price and TVL dropped. Kain says he was too optimistic about how soon Synthetix would be able to scale with optimistic roll-ups. If he were to do things again, he would probably use Polygon first and move to Optimism once the solution was ready. But last year was also a time to build on a strong foundation. He’s looking forward to the months to come, when all of that effort hopefully comes to light, with the protocol fully live on Optimism, with perpetual swaps expected to be launched too. He’s a firm believer that Ethereum and its Layer 2 solutions will capture the most value being built in DeFi and web3.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Behind the Scenes of The Defiant with Robin and Camila]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to The Defiant podcast! After a brief break at the end of last year, we’re back stronger and better than ever to continue chatting with the greatest and brightest minds in DeFi and web3. Our first guest is our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/IamSuperMassive">Robin Schmidt, aka SuperMassive</a>. Robin leads multimedia at the Defiant and produces our video content, which has become known for raising the bar way beyond what’s expected not just from crypto videos, but from all of YouTube. If you haven’t already, check out and subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thedefiant">our channel</a>. I wanted to do the first video of the year with Robin to get the chance to talk about The Defiant itself – what moves us, what sets us apart and what we’re expecting for this year. After over a year working together, I also wanted to finally shine the spotlight on the man behind the video host, and hear the story of how he got here.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Geoff Cook on Building a Crypto Name: "The Strongest Brands Compete on Emotion"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with <a href="https://www.basedesign.com/">Geoff Cook, co-founder of Base</a>, a design studio with huge clients from all industries, including The New York Times, MoMA, ING Bank and large-scale projects like JFK’s Terminal 4 and the Meatpacking District in New York. Geoff hopes to soon add crypto to the list. He recently wrote an article stating that <a href="https://www.basedesign.com/opinions/branding-cryptocurrency-coins">"For Crypto, Branding Could be the Highest Currency</a>” as the success of these projects will rely on communicating complex concepts and features to gain mass adoption. We discuss that crypto is in its teenage years in terms of branding: crypto, and especially DeFi projects, are rebelling against traditional finance and web2, but they’re still seeking to belong to a group and are not expressing their own individual characteristics and values. This is making all DeFi brands look alike. Geoff says that a company, or in the case of crypto, a protocol, that wants to build a powerful brand needs to figure out the story they want to tell.</p>

He recently wrote an article stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basedesign.com/opinions/branding-cryptocurrency-coins&quot;&gt;&quot;For Crypto, Branding Could be the Highest Currency&lt;/a&gt;” as the success of these projects will rely on communicating complex concepts and features to gain mass adoption. We discuss that crypto is in its teenage years in terms of branding: crypto, and especially DeFi projects, are rebelling against traditional finance and web2, but they’re still seeking to belong to a group and are not expressing their own individual characteristics and values. This is making all DeFi brands look alike. Geoff says that a company, or in the case of crypto, a protocol, that wants to build a powerful brand needs to figure out the story they want to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Nadya of Pussy Riot: "We Can Be Truly Unstoppable if We Combine Our Ideals With Tools that Crypto Provides"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I, speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot">Nadya Tolokonnikova</a>, one of the founding members of the feminist punk rock protest collective, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot">Pussy Riot</a>. Nadya has been protesting against the repression of individual freedoms in Russia since she was 17. She started Pussy Riot to focus on women and non-binary people as she noticed leadership would always fall on men. The group started performing in the streets of Moscow and were being repeatedly arrested for a few hours at a time, until one day in 2012, Nadya was put in jail for two years, for performing in a church. She believes art is a more effective vehicle for influencing hearts and minds than politics and that’s why she continues to perform. This year, she discovered she can use cryptocurrency and NFTs as tools to amplify her art, and coordinate people and capital on a global scale.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Zeneca: "The Market is Fed Up With the Same Sorts of NFT Projects and There's a Flight to Gaming NFTs"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33">Zeneca</a> is an NFT investor and content creator who grew his collection of non-fungible tokens from 0 to about 3,000 pieces worth millions in less than a year. He comes on the podcast to talk about how he went from professional poker player to full-time NFT trader, and what lessons from poker he has brought over to crypto.Zeneca believes the NFT market has hit a downturn amid rising crypto prices because it has become saturated with the same types of projects. He believes avatars will take a back seat to projects where NFTs have utility beyond displaying the art itself and being part of a community. That’s why gaming is setting up to be the next big movement in NFTs, he says. Still, he doesn’t believe we’ve seen a true bull and bear market yet — that will come when NFTs better integrate with DeFi and leverage comes into play.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[🎙 Scoopy Trooples of Alchemix: "Liquidity Mining is Like a Drug; You Have to Wean Yourself Off Over Time"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/scupytrooples">Scoopy Trooples</a>, founder of <a href="https://app.alchemix.fi/">Alchemix</a>, a protocol that programs self-paying loans without the risk of liquidations. Think about that; here’s a DeFi application that promises to automatically pay users’ collateralized loans, and on top of that, guarantee they won’t be liquidated. Scoopy explains how something like that can work and it’s all about plugging into other money legos like Yearn Finance to earn yield off that collateral and use that yield to pay off loans. Scoopy also goes into Alchemix v2 and into what he believes is a new movement in DeFi, which he helped coin as DeFi 2.0. Scoopy says dapps will now have options besides yield farming to attract liquidity to their protocols, which will allow teams to better control assets in their smart contracts, increasing capital efficiency.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode I speak with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scupytrooples&quot;&gt;Scoopy Trooples&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.alchemix.fi/&quot;&gt;Alchemix&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that programs self-paying loans without the risk of liquidations. Think about that; here’s a DeFi application that promises to automatically pay users’ collateralized loans, and on top of that, guarantee they won’t be liquidated. Scoopy explains how something like that can work and it’s all about plugging into other money legos like Yearn Finance to earn yield off that collateral and use that yield to pay off loans. Scoopy also goes into Alchemix v2 and into what he believes is a new movement in DeFi, which he helped coin as DeFi 2.0. Scoopy says dapps will now have options besides yield farming to attract liquidity to their protocols, which will allow teams to better control assets in their smart contracts, increasing capital efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/adamjacksonsf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Jackson</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.usebraintrust.com/">Braintrust</a>, a user-owned talent network. Think Fiverr for web3. Braintrust runs on Ethereum, has thousands of users, household names like NASA, TaskRabbit, Nike and Nestlé are clients, it has processed millions of dollars, yet not many people in the crypto community have heard of it. &nbsp;And it may be by design, as the team has focused on building the platform looking outside of crypto. Adam believes the so-called gig economy is broken because platforms are incentivized to extract as much value as they can, leaving workers feeling like they’ve been cheated. &nbsp;The way to fix it, he says, is through market-driven solutions using Web 3.0, DeFi and user-owned marketplaces.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstreetbets">Jaime Rogozinski</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a>, the famous Reddit trading group which <a href="https://thedefiant.io/wsb-wants-to-tear-down-the-old-financial-system-defi-wants-to-build-a-new-one/">earlier this year organized</a> to push up the price of heavily shorted stocks like Gamestop and AMC to create a short squeeze, which had the double benefit of amplifying the group’s gains and screwing over big hedge funds. Jaime goes over what led him to create the subreddit back in 2012 and how it grew into several thousands and then millions of members. He started Wall Street Bets to make money, but also because he believed the financial system was broken and so-called retail traders should have a chance against the big guys. A lot of those sentiments mirror ideals that fuel the cryptocurrency community and so it’s only natural that after his exit from Wallet Street Bets, he has found his way into crypto.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_sigel?lang=en">Matthew Sigel</a>, head of digital asset research at <a href="https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/">VanEck</a>, an asset management firm overseeing $80 billion, which has shifted its focus heavily into crypto. They started out with investments almost exclusively in Bitcoin, but now, with Matthew on board, the firm is becoming increasingly bullish on Ethereum and DeFi.</p>
<p>Matthew has a very methodical way of analyzing cryptocurrencies, applying the same rigorous methods used in traditional finance, and so it becomes even more compelling to hear him make the case for Ethereum’s market cap growing to $2 trillion. He also believes even after this year’s bull run, Ethereum and most DeFi protocols are trading cheaper than Web 2.0 and with better growth.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode we speak with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthew_sigel?lang=en&quot;&gt;Matthew Sigel&lt;/a&gt;, head of digital asset research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/&quot;&gt;VanEck&lt;/a&gt;, an asset management firm overseeing $80 billion, which has shifted its focus heavily into crypto. They started out with investments almost exclusively in Bitcoin, but now, with Matthew on board, the firm is becoming increasingly bullish on Ethereum and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew has a very methodical way of analyzing cryptocurrencies, applying the same rigorous methods used in traditional finance, and so it becomes even more compelling to hear him make the case for Ethereum’s market cap growing to $2 trillion. He also believes even after this year’s bull run, Ethereum and most DeFi protocols are trading cheaper than Web 2.0 and with better growth.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA["There's Going to Be a DeFi Universe Geared Towards Non-Fungible Assets:" NFTfi's Stephen Young]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/stephen_yo">Stephen Young</a>, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>, a platform for enabling NFT-backed loans. For some people, decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens sit on two separate worlds; DeFi on one end with its different lending, boring, and trading applications, and NFTs, with their digital art, music royalties and collectibles. Entrepreneurs like Stephen sit at the intersection, with a platform that uses NFTs to provide a financial product. He says volume on the platform is booming, as many new NFT owners find they can now get liquidity from digital property they don’t want to sell, while lenders can get more attractive rates for their crypto. Stephen believes this is just the beginning, and that eventually, real-world assets will also become digital property incorporated in the growing world of NFT and DeFi.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["NFTs are Giving Way to The First Art Revolution Since the Internet:" SuperRare's John Crain]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperRareJohn"><strong>John Crain</strong></a>, the co-founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://superrare.com/"><strong>SuperRare</strong></a>, one of the top NFT marketplaces. SuperRare wants to differentiate itself by being the NFT marketplace that best curates art, specifically. John believes the natural evolution for NFT platforms will be to specialize in verticals. The team recently launched a token and a DAO, and John explains how the move will be instrumental for SuperRare to scale its curation, as the original team gives up control and other participants propose and vote on what should go on the platform. We talk about the NFT boom more broadly, and how John believes NFTs are enabling the first artistic revolution since the internet.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["There's Been a Zero-to-One Switch for Institutions and Crypto:" Pantera's Dan Morehead]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_pantera">Dan Morehead</a>, the founder of one of the longest-standing and largest crypto funds. Dan founded <a href="https://panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a> in 2003 as a global macro hedge fund. In 2013, Pantera began investing in Bitcoin and quickly shifted its entire focus into crypto. Today, Pantera manages $3.8 billion in digital assets and equity in blockchain companies. Dan said Pantera is planning on increasing the Bitcoin exposure on its liquid tokens fund from zero to somewhere in the teens, while its main bet will remain DeFi. Dan is most excited about what he views is a shift in institutions’ interest in crypto. Firms which had told him they would never come close to holding crypto, are now wanting to dip their toes. And in a still small market, that has the potential to make big waves.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode, we speak with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_pantera&quot;&gt;Dan Morehead&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of one of the longest-standing and largest crypto funds. Dan founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://panteracapital.com/&quot;&gt;Pantera Capital&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 as a global macro hedge fund. In 2013, Pantera began investing in Bitcoin and quickly shifted its entire focus into crypto. Today, Pantera manages $3.8 billion in digital assets and equity in blockchain companies. Dan said Pantera is planning on increasing the Bitcoin exposure on its liquid tokens fund from zero to somewhere in the teens, while its main bet will remain DeFi. Dan is most excited about what he views is a shift in institutions’ interest in crypto. Firms which had told him they would never come close to holding crypto, are now wanting to dip their toes. And in a still small market, that has the potential to make big waves.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot">Ryan Selkis</a>, CEO and founder of <a href="https://messari.io/">Messari</a>, one of the most popular crypto data and research companies. &nbsp;Recently, Ryan has been very vocal about crypto regulation in the US. We talk about how he believes the infrastructure bill was a catalyzing event for the whole American crypto ecosystem. He believes while there are think tanks and corporate-led lobbying groups, the space is missing a grassroots entity that gives a voice to the millions of crypto users in the US that so energetically came to life against this bill. That’s why he’s creating a group to help mobilize voters in the crypto community to support pro-crypto candidates.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we interview <a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain">Nate Chastain</a>, head of product at OpenSea. <a href="https://opensea.io/">Opensea</a> got its start back in 2017 when CryptoKitties launched on Ethereum. After those digital cats, the NFT space was pretty dead for the next couple of years. Now OpenSea is reaping the rewards of hanging through that NFT winter, as NFT summer explodes with punks, apes, penguins and more cats. Nate was openSea’s first product hire and now he’s making sure that what started out as a platform for essentially CryptoKitties and a couple of other projects, can deal with millions of digital assets. He talks about the scaling challenges OpenSea is facing and what’s next on the roadmap after raising $100M dollars in a round led by a16z. The daily records in volume and users, are proving the founders right in thinking maybe it’s not finance that will take crypto to mainstream, but something that looks like a cute game.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[ "We Get to Tell Future Pixar Animators They Can Quit Their Jobs and Come Build With NFTs:" Stoner Cats Team]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with some of the creators and investors behind <a href="https://thedefiant.io/stoner-cats-nfts/">Stoner Cats</a>, the NFT-infused adult cartoon show about a group of cats who become sentient from their owner’s marihuana. And there are famous humans behind these cats, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin is one, and Jane Fonda is another. Ashton Kutcher’s VC fund is also involved. With all these big names, there was huge anticipation around this NFT sale -- so much, that the demand made Ethereum gas prices spike, so that many purchases didn’t go through and over <a href="https://thedefiant.io/stoner-cats-nft-drop-sells-out-but-would-be-buyers-bite-back-over-failed-transactions/">$700,000 were lost</a> in failed transactions. Ashton Kutcher said after this interview that the team is going to personally gift ETH to cover all failed transaction fees. Producer Lisa Sterbakov, investors Maaria Bajwa, Morgan Beller, and NFT creator Jonathan Howard, talk about the motivation behind Stoner Cats, how NFTs is changing the game for creators, what the chaotic launch was like for them, how they got Vitalik to join the show, and more behind the scenes scoops.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["I'm Not an Enemy of DeFi; I Want People to Know About Anything That Goes Against DeFi as a Tool for Financial Liberty:" Chris Blec]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec">Chris Blec</a>, a researcher advocating for transparency in DeFi. &nbsp;He was first drawn to cryptocurrencies through Bitcoin. He decided to go into crypto full time, first consulting with a token project in the ICO days, and later, in late 2019, by creating a YouTube channel where he aimed to educate users on how DeFi projects work under the hood. Here is where he came across what has become his focus since; the actual centralization behind supposedly decentralized protocols.All these questions and what appears to be constant criticism inspired some in the DeFi community to try to raise $50M for him to quit crypto. Meanwhile, Cointelegraph wrote a feature piece calling him maybe the most annoying man in DeFi. Chris seems unphased. To him, he’s just doing his part so that we don’t waste this opportunity to make a new, better financial system.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode, I interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec&quot;&gt;Chris Blec&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher advocating for transparency in DeFi. &amp;nbsp;He was first drawn to cryptocurrencies through Bitcoin. He decided to go into crypto full time, first consulting with a token project in the ICO days, and later, in late 2019, by creating a YouTube channel where he aimed to educate users on how DeFi projects work under the hood. Here is where he came across what has become his focus since; the actual centralization behind supposedly decentralized protocols.All these questions and what appears to be constant criticism inspired some in the DeFi community to try to raise $50M for him to quit crypto. Meanwhile, Cointelegraph wrote a feature piece calling him maybe the most annoying man in DeFi. Chris seems unphased. To him, he’s just doing his part so that we don’t waste this opportunity to make a new, better financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[“The Biggest, Clearest Bet of All is Ethereum:" Raoul Pal]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI"><strong>Raoul Pal</strong></a>, who retired from the hedge fund world at 36 years old and has run financial media company <a href="https://www.realvision.com/"><strong>Real Vision</strong></a> for the seven years since. He predicted the housing bubble, he was early to call the devastating effect the pandemic would have on the economy, and now he gives us his thoughts on what he sees is coming up in the next few months. Raoul believes the second half of 2021 will be worse than expected, but that the decline will be short-lived thanks to even more stimulus to be added to the global economy. This will cause risk assets to continue their climb, including crypto. And for that he’s well-positioned: he says 100% of his liquid net worth is in cryptocurrencies but if he had to own just one asset over the next 12 months, that would be ETH.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["It's Almost Like EIP-1559 Fixes an Economic Bug in Ethereum; More Usage Can Now Capture More Value:" Tim Beiko]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko">Tim Beiko</a>, who organizes the Ethereum core developers calls and knows all the intricacies and latest development of the world’s most active blockchain. We spoke right after Beiko had proposed a date for the implementation of one of the biggest changes expected to happen to the Ethereum blockchain in recent history EIP 1559. If you’re not 100% clear on what this means, fear not, because Tim explains in non-dev terms exactly how this change will reduce volatility in Ethereum gas prices and also reduce the uncertainty of whether user transactions are approved or not. Importantly, it also means that part of ETH paid per transaction will be burned. That means that if demand for ETH and use of the Ethereum blockchain are greater than ETH issued, it should put pressure on the ether price to increase.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/danrobinson"><strong>Dan Robinson</strong></a>, a research partner at <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/"><strong>Paradigm</strong></a>, one of the most active VC funds in DeFi and crypto. One of the fund’s investments is Unsiwap, where Dan also had a central role in the design of v3, the latest version of DeFi’s most popular decentralized exchange.

He believes the new design will impact DeFi and crytpo, while rolling back the very revolution Uniswap itself prompted by creating a more hybrid model.</p>

We talk about the emergence of the social token economy, and how that’s different from the creator economy or the gig economy; the difference is that social tokens and DAOs allow individuals to create wealth rather than create revenue. &nbsp;They’re tools for creators, and importantly, also for creator’ fans, to build something that’s similar to equity in a company, instead of having a salary.

			<title><![CDATA["VCs Typically Treat Community as an Afterthought; That's Wrong:" Soona Amhaz]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/soonaorlater"><strong>Soona Amhaz</strong></a> of Volt Capital. Soona saw the value of crypto from very close when her family lost most of their savings after Lebanon’s currency crashed. She immediately told them to move their money to Bitcoin to protect themselves against further currency devaluation and currency controls.</p>
<p>She was working on a startup as an engineer while trying to learn about bitcoin and onboard others into the space, and she realized there was very little information about crypto. So she decided to start the newsletter called Token Daily. The newsletter went from being a network of information to a network of people thanks to live events. That’s how she got to meet great teams building interesting projects in crypto and see their progress before anyone else did. When she saw big funds come in and invest in the projects she also knew had potential, she realized she had an edge and decided to start her own fund, Volt Capital.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[ "Having Legal Tender in a Currency You Cannot Control Means You Cannot Print Problems Away:" Mariano Conti ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/nanexcool"><strong>Mariano Conti</strong></a>, the former head of smart contracts at MakerDAO. Mariano knows the value of having permissionless and uncensorable currencies first hand —he started earning in Bitcoin in 2014 in Argentina because pesos would instantly lose value and it was hard to get dollars. When he learned about Ethereum he went all in and started working at Makerdao before DeFi was even a thing in 2016. When Dai was created, he was one of the first to take out a collateralized loan against his ETH and used that loan to buy a car. It must have been the first DeFi loan used to buy an actual physical thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto space has come a long way since with an entire financial system built out of money legos and this week with a huge milestone of El Salvador becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Mariano talks about this historical moment and why it’s significant that it was a Latin American country to take this step.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["Everyone Can be Rich in Crypto; There are no Divine Rights:" Terry Crews]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with Terry Crews, a legit star. He was a professional football player, has starred in multiple Hollywood films and currently leads in TV shows including America’s Got Talent. He is also a cryptocurrency enthusiast, minting his own social token called POWER. Terry has a very powerful story on how he got into crypto. It was at a design show in Milan. He wanted to support his friend at the show, but wasn’t able to withdraw money from his own American Express account. He realized a financial system that’s based on trusting a long line of intermediaries is broken. He thought, even when he did everything right, and he was already wealthy and famous, he still got the door shut in his face —so what’s left for the rest? All of that cemented his view that the financial system should be permissionless, transparent and global.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["The Bull Market is Intact for the Next 10 to 20 Years; We are in a Secular Shift:" Arca's Jeff Dorman]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I interview Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, an investment management firm focusing on digital assets. Jeff has been valuing assets for the past 20 years, from investment-grade bonds, to high-yield debt and equities, and now he’s doing the same for crypto. We talk about the recent selloff and he thinks the big crash is over but that doesn’t mean we’ve seen the market bottom. Still, Jeff says this is a buying opportunity and he gives insights into which sectors will outperform and underperform. He believes we’re heading to a 10 to 20-year secular bull market in crypto, where there will be a decoupling of sectors and where DeFi continues to grow.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["Blockchains are Adding Property Rights to the Internet:" Kayvon Tehranian]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/saturnial">Kayvon Tehranian</a>, founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://foundation.app/">Foundation</a>, a platform for minting, buying and selling non-fungible tokens. We talked about the future of the internet —Kayvon believes blockchains are adding property rights to the internet. He also thinks that instead of having to wait for old institutions to come online, new ones in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOS, will be built. He foresees a future when a lot of people will start saying, ‘why aren't you asking me to connect my wallet? Why do I have to log in this other way, that I don't have control over what I'm doing?’ I also believe that future is not so far away.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["Ethereum is About Six Months Away from Proof-of-Stake:" Preston Van Loon ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode<strong>,</strong> we interview <a href="https://twitter.com/preston_vanloon">Preston Van Loon</a>. Preston co-founded <a href="https://prysmaticlabs.com/">Prysmatic Labs,</a> one of the main teams building Ethereum 2.0, and has been leading that team for the past three years. On top of that, he recently founded a DeFi project which bundles the entire crypto market cap in one token to allow anyone to easily buy something like a crypto index. Preston talks about the latest in ETH2 &nbsp;—he says Etheruem’s big migration into its proof-of-stake chain is about six months away, give or take two months. He says Ethereum may be at a disadvantage relative to other Layer 1s, which are launching with more scalable technologies. But he also believes it will be hard for other chains to build the community Ethereum has, faster than Ethereum will upgrade.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s podcast we interview<strong> </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/santisiri"><strong>Santiago Siri</strong></a><strong>, </strong>who has been working on improving the way democracy works for over a decade.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, we talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/gandalfthebr0wn?lang=en">Varun Kumar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pranaymohan">Pranay Mohan</a> from <a href="https://hashflow.com/">Hashflow</a>, a new decentralized exchange that wants to unbundle Uniswap. What this means is, they want to keep the non-custodial side and the liquidity pools, but instead of finding prices with smart contacts and a formula, they use market makers applying their highly specialized strategies and algorithms behind the scenes. Anyone can become a market maker, and some may open their pools so that others will be able to share their capital in exchange for a portion of trading fees. Their bet is that they will combine machines and humans in just the right way, to provide cheaper rates at lower prices.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[ "We're Lifting Barriers For Outside Users; If You Allocate Capital in a Vacuum, It's Kind of Meaningless:" Terra's Do Kwon]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, we interview <a href="https://twitter.com/d0h0k1">Do Kwon</a>, cofounder of the <a href="https://terra.money/">Terra</a> ecosystem which includes a payments network, a stablecoin, a lending protocol and a synthetic assets platform. We talk about how he was able to achieve what most crypto companies can’t which is to get a broad non-crypto native user base. Terra’s Chai payments system, which uses the Terra stablecoin, has about 2.6M active users in Korea. Kwon says there’s so much money to be made without bringing new people in, that many developers just settle with looking inwards in crypto.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s episode, we interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/d0h0k1&quot;&gt;Do Kwon&lt;/a&gt;, cofounder of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://terra.money/&quot;&gt;Terra&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem which includes a payments network, a stablecoin, a lending protocol and a synthetic assets platform. We talk about how he was able to achieve what most crypto companies can’t which is to get a broad non-crypto native user base. Terra’s Chai payments system, which uses the Terra stablecoin, has about 2.6M active users in Korea. Kwon says there’s so much money to be made without bringing new people in, that many developers just settle with looking inwards in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA["It's Not About Fighting for People Already in DeFi, But About Bringing More People In:" SushiSwap's 0xMaki ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode we interview 0xMaki, an anonymous DeFi developer contributing to SushiSwap and Yearn Finance protocols. We talk about growing Sushi beyond its drama-filled beginnings as a fork of Uniswap, into a DEX that can hold its own as the second-most active trading platform in Ethereum DeFi. He goes into the main pieces that set SushiSwap apart with its margin trading and a soon-to-be-released smart contract suite to easily launch tokens. He says, it’s short-sighted for DEX competitors to be fighting among each other, as they should be fighting outwards, to bring more people into DeFi, and not inwards trying to win over the people who are already here.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we talk with the DeFi artist of the moment. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pplpleasr/">Pplpleasr</a> got into DeFi drawn in by the crazy yields but really stayed when she resonated with the community &nbsp;—the gaming-like, niche subculture of memes and internet-native humor. She started making videos for many DeFi teams, from Yeran to Pickle Finance. Her latest and best-known work though is the video she made for the highly anticipated v3 of Uniswap. The <a href="https://foundation.app/pplpleasr/x-y-k-13623">clip of a unicorn</a> in an otherworldly oasis, Ethereum dapp symbols floating about, gained her universal praise. But it’s what happened later when it gets really interesting. Pplpleasr decided, like many other artists these days, to sell the video as an NFT. But unlike most artists fetching big chunks of cash, she was set on donating the proceeds to charity. Also unlike other auctions, it was a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, created just for the occasion, what ended up winning the piece.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with Antonio Juliano, founder and CEO of <a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dYdX</a>, one of the biggest decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, focusing on derivatives. dYdX recently made news by being one of the first major DeFi projects to <a href="https://thedefiant.io/dydx-is-latest-major-defi-project-to-move-to-l2/">move to Layer 2</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main goals for his team this year will be to further decentralize dYdX, Juliano said, from the order book to the control of their smart contracts. So yes, for those reading between the lines, that means decentralized governance, and Juliano <strong>isn’t ruling out a dYdX token. </strong>Juliano believes derivatives are going to be the biggest products in crypto and so his long-term goal is for dYdX to become one of the biggest crypto exchanges, period. He knows DEXes are just 5% of total crypto volume, but that’s up from 0% two years ago. He says, a lot of people are seeing the writing on the wall.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["I Don't Think We're in a Bubble. We Had a Bubble in ‘17; Now We're in a Movement:" Mike Novogratz]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with<a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz"> Mike Novogratz</a>, the CEO of Galaxy Digital. He started his career at Goldman Sachs and then led a macro hedge fund at Fortress, which was shuttered in 2015. He then went all-in on crypto, in part thanks to convincing from his college roommate Joe Lubin, and founded Galaxy Digital, an investment bank for digital assets. After grinding through the 2018 and 2019 bear market, Mike says he can finally breathe. He is convinced that Bitcoin is finally derisked.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin is firmly established as digital gold, to him, Ethereum is a venture bet because it’s not totally finished yet. It's getting there, and so the bet is it's going to happen, not that it's happened. Novo is wildly bullish DeFi. He says the threat to the banking system and payments is DeFi, not Bitcoin. But that also means the big guys are going to fight back with lobbying and regulation because protocols like Uniswap and Aave are going after their business.</p>
<p>About the hype and rally in the crypto market, Novo says this time it’s different. Unlike in 2017, he doesn’t believe we’re in a bubble. He says we’re in a movement.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["We Were Idiots and We Were Poor; Then From Mid 2020 to Now, Suddenly, We're Right: " Ameen Soleimani]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol">Ameen Soleimani</a>, one of the most prolific builders in Ethereum. He’s the CEO of SpankChain, a blockchain-based adult entertainment platform, the co-creator of MolochDAO, a DAO to fund Ethereum projects, and the co-founder of Reflexer Labs, which created <a href="https://thedefiant.io/cypherpunk-stablecoin-rai-is-live-on-ethereum/">RAI, a purely ether-backed stablecoin</a>.</p>
<p>We talk about the need of a purely ETH -backed stablecoin, and how RAI is so cypherpunk it’s not only not backed by fiat, but it’s also not pegged to the dollar, it’s only pegged to itself, and stabilized by its own algorithm. It’s a pretty radical experiment and Ameen has very high hopes for it: The goal is for Rai to become a global reserve currency.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["We Haven't Seen Anything Yet, So Hold Your Long-Term Bag:" Qiao Wang ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s podcast episode, we speak with long-time crypto investor <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao">Qiao Wang</a>. Wang is a partner at the DeFi Alliance and former head of product at Messari. Unlike many Bitcoiners who get into crypto because of their ideological views, or Ethereans attracted by the possibility of building decentralized apps, Wang had been a quant trader for 10 years when he first learned about Bitcoin, and it was the asset’s volatility and potential upside what drew him in. Years later, he’s still actively trading.</p>
<p>We talk about his portfolio and which coins look the most promising. He looks at all sorts of metrics to come to his trading conclusions. In the end though, he says, the market is purely driven by memes and Twitter influencers. About the current bull market, Wang says he’s 90% confident prices will go a lot higher. And while he doesn’t like to give price estimates, he still told me what he thinks the top for BTC and ETH will be for this cycle.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban">Mark Cuban</a>, Dallas Mavericks owner, billionaire investor and Shark Tank star. It’s been hard to pin down if Cuban is a crypto skeptic or believer. He has questioned the value of bitcoin and called its price surges a bubble, but he has also accepted crypto payments for his basketball team, and tweeted about using Aave and selling NFTs. You’ll have no doubt after listening to this interview where he stands: Cuban is a crypto bull, but more specifically a DeFi and Ethereum bull.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["For the First Time, You Can Buy a Piece of the Art, and a Piece of the Gallery:" MetaKovan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s podcast episode we interview MetaKovan, the pseudonymous investor who holds the largest known NFT collection in his Metapruse fund, which he leads with his (also pseudonymous partner) Twobadour. MetaKovan made waves in the surging NFT space after buying all 20 pieces of the <a href="https://twitter.com/beeple/status/1338710051746435072">Beeple collection</a> at auction for $2.5M. In this interview, we dive into how exactly he managed to get his hands in the entire collection and what the bigger purpose of holding those pieces was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MetaKovan didn’t buy the 20 pieces to just hold them in his wallet. Instead he and Twobadour built sprawling museums across the metaverse, added original ambient music by 3LAU, bundled it all together, and tokenized it. The B20 tokens are now the keys to owning this experience</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Crypto Devs Are "Building a Life Raft For The World After Fiat Falls Apart:" Erik Voorhees]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode, I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees">Erik Voorhees</a>, long-time crypto advocate and founder and CEO of <a href="https://shapeshift.com/">ShapeShift</a>. In this interview, he talks about how he was able to stop gathering information about his customers and take the exchange back to its roots, by leaning into DeFi. His plan is to create a platform that connects with all of the different DeFi applications, starting with decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Voorhees holds probably the most extreme view of anyone who has come on this podcast. He thinks we will see the collapse of the US dollar within our lifetime. He argues the level of US debt and continuous erosion of the currency is untenable. When this happens an entire financial ecosystem built on open, immutable blockchains will be the solution. He believes today’s developers aren’t just building a product for their customers. They’re building a life raft for the world after fiat falls apart.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I interview Fred Chesnias, the CEO of Atari. &nbsp;The video game company now has a token and plans to release a wallet and even an exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;The token is an erc20, which Atari hopes will get used across any game, not just their own. &nbsp;&nbsp;With the token, users will be able to buy Atari NFTs, which include wearables to make a fashion statement in the metaverse. Fred believes blockchain and crypto can be a way to make it out of poverty, even leveraging video games themselves, reselling avatars and in-game items.</p>
<p>Beyond blockchains he also talks about business; Chesnias was able to take Atari out of deep financial stress and turn it around. He gives advice to founders and business owners going through difficult times. One of the three main lessons he learned was to oversimplify. Listen to find out what else!</p>

			<title><![CDATA["Bitcoin is the Most Honest Form of Money We've Ever Had:" Robert Sharratt of CrescoFin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with Robert Sharratt, managing director at <a href="https://crescofin.ch/">CrescoFin</a>, a Swiss-regulated crypto firm which wants to become a bank alternative. He says Cresco’s objective is to replace banking with code. And while that sounds revolutionary, he’s the first to admit he’s in a “boring business.” He’s not building a yield farming platform that can get you 1,000x yield. He’s building a savings account that’s backed by real-world assets like invoices, for users to deposit fiat currency in exchange for returns of about 3%. Instead of Yolo-ing into untested smart contracts, he’s offering a product that’s insured by Lloyd’s of London. While this may sound a lot like trad-fi, Ethereum smart contracts are used as the one source behind it all.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["We Took Lessons From the Food Festival to Level Up the DeFi Experience," Bloq's Jeff Garzik ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode I talk with Jeff Garzik, the Bitcoin core developer turned DeFi builder. &nbsp;Jeff comes from leading Bloq, a blockchain infrastructure company focusing on enterprises. As much as decentralized finance is exciting and groundbreaking, he believes its lacking professionalism. Jeff believes DeFi needs to be easy for retail users and for institutional users, not just for crypto natives. With that goal in mind, Bloq is launching Vesper, a decentralized protocol for users to gain passive interest on their crypto. The innovation relative to other yield bouncers, is that users can pick a risk level and the protocol will invest in different strategies accordingly. It both competes with, and uses Yearn Finance. We also talked about what’s next for DeFi, and how he believes the space will trend towards “hybrid finance,” where traditional finance will progressively adopt this infrastructure to become more open and global.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanDGeorge">Stefan George</a>, the cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://gnosis.io/">Gnosis</a>. Gnosis is one of the OG Ethereum projects. It was founded in 2015 by Stefan and Martin Koppelman as a prediction market platform on Ethereum and it’s now an ecosystem of financial applications, with a decentralized multi-sig wallet, called Gnosis Safe, and a decentralized exchange. Most recently, Gnosis announced it will join other DeFi projects and launch a DAO, where it would transfer a large chunk of the ether and GNO tokens in its treasury for the community to manage.</p>
<p>This treasury is sizeable at around $100M dollars, due to the rising price of the 250,000 ETH they raised in a 2017 ICO. And this stash has been the core of a dispute with one of Gnosis token holders, hedge fund Arca. Arca claims the Gnosis token is trading below the value of the Gnosis treasury, and so they have proposed that Gnosis buy back their tokens at a value that’s between the current market value and the value of the treasury —or the book value.</p>
<p>Stefan argues the GNO market cap is miscalculated because it’s not counting the actual number of tokens in circulation and should be higher. He also says the Gnosis DAO should drive more value to GNO holders.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with E.G. Galano, cofounder of Infura, an infrastructure provider for Ethereum and other blockchains. Many Ethereum applications depend on Infura to run their nodes, and it became apparent why that’s problematic recently, when the service provider was having trouble connecting to the Ethereum blockchain, causing much of DeFi to break down. E.G. dives into the recent outage; he goes into what went wrong and what Infrua is doing to make sure it doesn’t happen again. He also talks about DeFi from the backstage perspective of an infrastructure provider, and what he says might get you feeling even more bullish on this space.</p>

She then went to work with one of Goldman’s hedge fund clients, where she managed a long-short portfolio. With all that experience and $20 million dollars from a seed investor, she ventured on her own to launch a hedge fund —but failed. The time, costs and administrative hassle were too much to handle even with an investment of millions, which in that world, is actually pretty tiny. She came to the conclusion that the next step for her would be to build a blockchain-based protocol so that nobody would have to experience what she did when trying to set up an investment fund. A platform that made the process so much cheaper, faster and easier, that anybody could become a hedge fund manager. That’s how Melon Protocol came about.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I speak with <strong>Illia Polosukhin, cofounder of the </strong><a href="https://near.org/"><strong>Near </strong></a><strong>Protocol and Fernando Martinelli, co-founder and CEO of </strong><a href="https://balancer.finance/"><strong>Balancer Labs</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Near is one of the up and coming Layer 1 chains, Balancer is a prominent DeFi protocol and application on Ethereum that will now also be on Near and other blockchains. As for Near being labeled an “Ethereum Killer” Illia says Near is “not trying to kill anybody.”<strong> </strong>He thinks finance is just a stepping stone for all the use cases enabled by blockchains and that Near can be the place where those consumer apps are built. Fernando says DeFi will live on many different Layer 1s, but he sees the space expanding into less than 10, not hundreds of chains. He remains very bullish on Ethereum and is betting on a flippening with Bitcoin in the near future, which Illia agreed would be “totally possible.”</p>

			<title><![CDATA["When Incentives Are Gone, What's Left? DeFi Gets Mixed Marks:" Sam Bankman-Fried ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s interview, I speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, co-founder and CEO of crypto liquidity provider Alameda Research and derivatives exchange FTX, and with <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko">Anatoly Yakovenko</a>, the creator of the Solana blockchain. Bankman-Fried, recently announced the launch of Serum, a DEX built on the Solana blockchain. SBF has become known to be a ruthless trader, but he argues he’s simply using DeFi protocols for what they were made. For Anatoly, the end goal of Solana is to find the fastest and cheapest way to scale cryptography so that people are able to have ownership and participation in the applications they use, and so that the financial system can become more open efficient.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s interview is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yung_Skeeter">Trevor McFedries</a>, who is behind <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en">Lil Miquela</a>, a 19-year-old aspiring pop star with almost 3M Instagram followers, striking deals with Clavin Klein and Prada. But what’s more surprising is that she’s not human. She’s a computer-generated, character. The company that Trevor co-founded, called Brud, created her image and life story. It’s only fitting then that Lil Miquela, who lives in a digital world, will start to leverage digital tokens.</p>
<p>[Note: Trevor says in the interview a Miquela drop on SuperRare would happen on Oct. 30 or 31, but they’ve since changed the date to November 17. So you’re still on time to participate.]</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The founder of Summa speaks to The Defiant about why he has become disillusioned with decentralized finance.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s podcast episode I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/TorBair?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tor Bair</a>, the founder of Secret Foundation, an organization which promotes privacy-preserving technologies, with a focus on <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>. Secret Network is a proof-of-stake, Cosmos-based blockchain, which has the capacity to process private transactions and, notably, private smart contracts.</p>
<p>Tor says that for Web3 to develop into the open and permissionless system its builders want, privacy should be at the core. His biggest fear is that in a Web3 future, intead of having single corporations control our data, governments will have the same access too. Without private blockchains, Web3 could devolve to enable surveillance capitalism, where auditability is weaponized. Tor talks about the technologies that are being built today to stop that from happening.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["Fair Launch is a New Way for Founders to Express Themselves:" Gavin McDermott of IDEO CoLab]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Defiers! In this week’s interview, I spoke with Gavin McDermott. He's an investor at IDEO CoLab Ventures, the venture arm of design firm IDEO, and he’s one of the creators of Fair Launch Capital. While the name might suggest otherwise, Fair Launch Capital isn’t an investment firm, or at least it’s not a traditional investment firm. Instead, it gives startups no-strings-attached funding so that they can afford security audits and launch their projects in a safe way. They’re asked to consider paying it forward by returning at least the same amount they got but ideally more, to fund the next project.</p>
<p>The idea came after the team saw that many founders in crypto were feeling forced to either sell tokens before their platform launched or raise venture capital as one option to pay for audits, or release their projects without the proper security checks. Gavin is hoping fair launch capital provides a viable alternative to venture capital, even if it does end up disrupting his fund's own business model. Since the group unveiled this new funding mechanism late august, the term “fair launch” has taken a life of its own, becoming a gold standard for any new DeFi venture.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode, I spoke with Dan Elitzer and Clinton Bembry, who were part of the founding team of Yam. Yam Finance is an experiment in rebasing cryptocurrencies, plus token incentives, plus full on-chain governance, plus a DAO-like treasury managed by token holders. It’s also testing the power of the emoji and opened the flood gates to meme-based DeFi tokens.</p>
<p>Dan and Clinton tell me the back story of how this crazy project was created, how the group loosely coalesced in a chat group and from there it was just 10 days until launch. They talked about how the project blew past all their wildest expectations, and about the absolute terror of having hundreds of millions of dollars flow into the unaudited code they had pushed into the world.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s interview is with Jeff Zirlin, aka Jihoz, growth lead at <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/#">Axie Infinity</a>. Axie is a digital game built on Ethereum, which involves cute animals going to battle against each other and taking control of your digital assets. The big vision is that as we increasingly live our lives in the digital world, digital assets will become more and more important and applications like Axie Infinity, will become more than just games, but places where people work and socialize. The key value that blockchains and NFT tokens add to this picture is that we’ll be able to actually own these assets. There will be no company or centralized entity able to ban an account and take their assets away.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This week’s interview is with Jeff Zirlin, aka Jihoz, growth lead at &lt;a href=&quot;https://axieinfinity.com/#&quot;&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;. Axie is a digital game built on Ethereum, which involves cute animals going to battle against each other and taking control of your digital assets. The big vision is that as we increasingly live our lives in the digital world, digital assets will become more and more important and applications like Axie Infinity, will become more than just games, but places where people work and socialize. The key value that blockchains and NFT tokens add to this picture is that we’ll be able to actually own these assets. There will be no company or centralized entity able to ban an account and take their assets away.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA["It Turns Out Music Does Have Value. We've Been Pricing It Incorrectly For 20 Years:" RAC ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Defiers! In this week’s interview, we chatted with Grammy Award-winning DJ Andre Anjos, aka RAC. Many have seen cryptocurrencies as a way to decentralize the financial system, thanks to the innovation of digital scarcity. RAC says that digital scarcity can also help disrupt the music industry. His experiments have so far showed how distributed networks can be the underlying infrastructure that helps artists can sell their creations directly to fans; how tokens on open markets can help more accurately price goods and help them benefit from secondary trading of their products; and now how digital assets can help strengthen communities.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Stani Kulechov the founder and CEO of Aave. When we spoke Aave was the second-largest DeFi protocol, but in the days after our conversation, it rose to overtake MakerDAO and become the DeFi platform with the most assets held in its smart contracts, at over $1B in digital assets. It’s been an exponential rise for Aave, which launched just eight months ago and in that short time was able to climb the famous Defi Pulse Total Value Locked ranking to the top. It’s done so pushing DeFi forward by driving innovation in interest-generating tokens, flash loans and delegated credit lines, which are all lowering the barriers of entry to users from all corners of the world to access financial applications. We also get into all the recent yield farming craziness, which he wishes was more restrained.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Santiago Roel is partner at ParaFi Capital, one of the most active investment funds in DeFi. Before going full crypto, Santiago worked at JPMorgan’s investment banking arm, and then invested in fintech and software at a venture fund. He now uses his more traditional VC frameworks to analyze open financial protocols and finds that even by those metrics, DeFi comes out ahead. We also talked about the seemingly crazy new DeFi meme tokens and Santiago says to not underestimate their value. Maybe part of the reason traders are pouring millions into these tokens comes from the human desire to connect with others.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode I speak with Alex Masmej, the first person to raise money by selling tokens not linked to any project, but linked to himself, in a sort of self-IPO. Much like shareholders taking dividends, Alex token holders can have a share of the entrepreneur’s future earnings. The money raised has helped him cover living expenses as he plans to move from Paris to San Francisco and start a tech company. He’s willing to try almost anything and see what sticks. In one of his experiments, he let ALEX holders vote on his daily habits, which is how he came to run 5km almost daily. Most recently, he announced token rewards in exchange for holders to add liquidity to exchanges where Alex is traded. We talk about how to better align token holders' incentives with his own, what mainstream personal tokens may look like, and the Black Mirrorish quality of it all.</p>

There’s this sort of mysticism around Andre: The solo genius builder who relentlessly releases code even if it hasn’t always been properly audited or tested. The DeFi wizard capable of turning a token which he himself claimed to be valueless to be worth thousands of dollars in a few days. He talks about the actual paralyzing fear that comes with building money protocol, the huge responsibility he feels, and how finger-pointing has caused him to quit the space before. But he says the drive to continue innovating has helped him overcome that fear and keep building.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s episode, I speak with Polychain Capital founder <strong>Olaf Carlson-Wee.</strong> He was already telling Wired magazine about programmatic finance back in 2016, so it’s no surprise Olaf is very excited about the growth and promise of DeFi. He thinks smart contracts are enabling different ways of organizing people and capital, turning traditional corporations into internet sovereign corporations. He believes that given a compelling underlying product, liquidity mining will be an incredibly effective mechanism for accelerating network effects, which will be applicable to many different types of business models even beyond financial services.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s epidose I speak with Bette Chen and Ruitao Su, who are building DeFi on Polkadot. While most of DeFi is being built on Etheruem, here is the team creating an entire new financial infrastructure on the decentralized network built by the Web3 Foundations and Parity Technologies —which was founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. Their project called Acala, has been mostly known for its stablecoin, but they’re also building staking derivatives —a token that’s a derivative of staked DOT tokens and can be used in DeFi— and a DEX. Each one of these pieces is a huge undertaking on their own, but this ambitious team is making all of them at the same time.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode, I speak with Lasse Clausen, founding partner of 1kx, one of the most active venture funds in DeFi. A typical VC question in the traditional tech space is it a 10x? Is it 10 times faster, better, cheaper? This concept has been dressed up very nicely as like, often with grand statements about making the world a better place, but really, Lasse says, VCs are subsidizing a market takeover. The real question they're asking is, can this become a national monopoly, where users are so locked in, that they have no choice but to use the product. Lasse thinks crypto will crack this system open and that the paradigm shift is so big that there will be some networks that are really 1,000x improvement over the status quo. That's why his fund is called 1kx.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s interview is with Vansa Chatikavanij , the CEO of <a href="https://omg.network/">OMG Network</a>. The Bangkok-based project formerly known as OmiseGo has spearheaded research and work on a scaling technology for Ethereum called Plasma. Scaling solutions will be key for Ethereum and therefore DeFi, &nbsp;to continue growing. The network is already at capacity, and gas prices are getting prohibitively high, especially for complex DeFi transactions.</p>
<p>In this interview we talk about OMG’s beginnings, the changes the project went through from conception until shipping, realizing that marketing should come after the project’s launch, and the different Ethereum scaling solutions. Most interesting to me is Vansa’s big vision of global value transfer as a basic human right and how she wants to help make that a reality.</p>

&lt;p&gt;In this interview we talk about OMG’s beginnings, the changes the project went through from conception until shipping, realizing that marketing should come after the project’s launch, and the different Ethereum scaling solutions. Most interesting to me is Vansa’s big vision of global value transfer as a basic human right and how she wants to help make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA["All the Dizzying Ways People are Farming Yield is Proof of DeFi Composability's Success:" Ampleforth CTO]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s interview, I spoke with <strong>Brandon Iles, the CTO of Ampleforth.</strong> Brandon &nbsp;is a former Google and Uber software engineer, and built his first crypto app together with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Today, he’s trying to rebuild the way money works.</p>
<p>For its huge ambitions, Ampleforth is a relatively little-known project. It wants to create an entirely new category of monetary assets — one that doesn’t have Bitcoin’s gold-like fixed supply, it doesn’t have Ether’s oil-like utility, it’s not fiat-backed like USDC, and it’s not collateralized like Dai. So what is it? It’s a token — AMPL— whose value comes from having a price which moves in a predetermined band, thanks to a smart contract which automatically contracts or expands its supply. The end result is a token that trades at close to $1, the 2019 US dollar, to be precise, but Ampleforth doesn’t like to be called a stablecoin —you're about to find out why.</p>
<p>We also talked about the project’s recent liquidity mining program called Geyser, where traders can earn AMPL by supplying liquidity on Uniswap, and how for Brandon, the dizzying activity around these schemes is proof of DeFi’s success. Brandon also discussed the project’s roadmap, from being used as a way to diversify collateral in lending platforms like Maker and Compound, to denominating debt obligations, to very far out into the future, replacing central bank issued currencies.</p>

The live together, work together, and spend all their time analyzing crypto startups, and actively participating in the protocols they fund.

			<title><![CDATA["The World is Crying for the Tech We're Building But We're Nowhere Near Ready:" Aragon's Luis Cuende]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s interview is with Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende. Aragon is a platform for users to create their own decentralized autonomous organizations. DAOS are organizations that have as much of its operations put into code as possible, and have smart contracts execute those operations. Owners hold tokens of the DAO, much like owners of a company hold shares, and make management decisions by voting with those tokens. They’re as transparent, immutable and secure as the blockchains they run on. Aragon wants to make it easy for anyone to build these futuristic companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cuende started this project in 2016, at a time when most had given up on these organizations after the crash of what’s likely the most well-known DAO so far, called The DAO. The space has recovered and in the past year, thousands of DAOs holding millions of dollars have flourished. The dream of more fair and open organizations, which anyone can access and create, is back at a time when the world seems to really need them. People are losing trust in institutions and crypto can provide an alternative. But Cuende says he’s saddened to discover the space is nowhere near ready.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["There's the Opportunity to Make Really Complex Financial Instruments More Accessible”: Opyn's Alexis Gauba]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s interview I talk with Alexis Gauba, the cofounder of Opyn. Alexis and her team built the first decentralized options market, on Ethereum. These instruments give investors a tool to protect against market volatility and Black Swan events, like hacks, bank runs, and big price crashes. In DeFi the risk is especially high, which explains why Opyn has taken off since its February launch.</p>
<p>Options are a key piece in traditional finance and make up the most liquid market in the world, with contracts representing trillions of dollars in value. Opyn contracts are not quite yet, and even if notional volume grew five times in the past month, it’s still under $40 million. But if DeFi ends up overtaking centralized finance, we could be witnessing the rebirth of this monster-sized market. The difference is that this time, everyone can access it, and anyone can build their own financial instruments on open sourced protocols.</p>
<p>Alexis shares more about how Opyn was born, the project’s traction, the next markets the team plans to add and what innovative projects devs are building on top of the protocol. She also gives a peak at what Opyn V2 might look like.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>This week’s interview is with Sergey Nazarov, the cofounder of oracle provider Chainlink. The way blockchain applications get their data has proven to be crucial, as failures in those systems have been at the core of many of the latest attacks in decentralized finance. He says developers are currently underestimating the complexities of building data aggregators and oracle systems and says, the only reason these dangerous patterns are not as discussed is because the losses have not been Mt.

			<title><![CDATA[Anyone Can Create Their Own ETF and Get Paid for It; This Wasn't Possible Before]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s interview is with <strong>Fernando Martinelli, co-founder and CEO of Balancer Labs. </strong>Balancer Labs is an AMM with a twist. Instead of liquidity providers having to deposit tokens in a pool at a pre-determined ratio together with a more liquid token (usually ETH), Balancer enables users to create token pools that have any ratio they want between their tokens. They can use any combination of tokens, and can even exclude ETH. &nbsp;The pools automatically rebalance when tokens’ price change, so that the same ratio is maintained. This way, liquidity providers are effectively creating something like a tokenized index fund, or ETF, in which anyone can invest. On the other side of the protocols are the liquidity takers, or traders, who can exchange tokens from these pools, or “ETFs.”</p>
<p>Traders pay a small fee, determined by liquidity providers, which means that unlike in traditional finance, where you have to pay ETF providers to trade index funds, you can create your own fund and get paid for it.</p>
<p>Fernando explains how Balancer works, and gives the scoop on what’s coming up next, which includes, an interface for non-technical users to create their own token pools, a Balancer token to be launched in V2, liquidity provider rewards using this new protocol token, and plans for decentralized governance. He also talks about Balancer’s business model, the steps it took to ensure the protocol is safe and the level of control the team has over the protocol —which he says is basically zero.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Blockchains are an Extinction-Level Event: Emin Gun Sirer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Emin Gun Sirer is a Cornell University computer science professor who has been deeply involved in the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities from the very early days. We talk about how he got started in the field, building a cryptocurrency long before Bitcoin. Gun, as friends call him, then turned his attention to Ethereum, notably catching the bug in The DAO, but failing to alert the community about it.</p>
<p>After years scrutinizing existing blockchains, he’s back at making one himself with <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">AVA</a>, whose testnet launched two weeks ago. He explains the inner workings of this network, the first built over the Avalanche protocol, and how it can process several thousands of transactions per second at latencies of under one second.</p>
<p>He also talks about his plans to release a subnetwork called Athereum shortly after the AVA mainnet launches in July. Athereum will be almost identical to Ethereum; it will replicate its smart contracts and assets, and ETH holders will hold the equivalent amount of ATH. Sirer says the intention is for Athereum to serve as a safety net in case something goes wrong with ETH 2.0. If this sounds like Ethereum’s old friend wants to bring on some serious competition to the second-biggest chain, that’s because he is. Still, he’s quick to highlight he wants Ethereum to succeed and that he’s not after Ethereum dollars, but rather after money flows that are outside of Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>

Gun, as friends call him, then turned his attention to Ethereum, notably catching the bug in The DAO, but failing to alert the community about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years scrutinizing existing blockchains, he’s back at making one himself with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avalabs.org/&quot;&gt;AVA&lt;/a&gt;, whose testnet launched two weeks ago. He explains the inner workings of this network, the first built over the Avalanche protocol, and how it can process several thousands of transactions per second at latencies of under one second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also talks about his plans to release a subnetwork called Athereum shortly after the AVA mainnet launches in July. Athereum will be almost identical to Ethereum; it will replicate its smart contracts and assets, and ETH holders will hold the equivalent amount of ATH. Sirer says the intention is for Athereum to serve as a safety net in case something goes wrong with ETH 2.0. If this sounds like Ethereum’s old friend wants to bring on some serious competition to the second-biggest chain, that’s because he is. Still, he’s quick to highlight he wants Ethereum to succeed and that he’s not after Ethereum dollars, but rather after money flows that are outside of Ethereum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Crypto Was Made for Crises: MEW's Kosala Hemachandra]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Defiers! This week’s interview is with MyEtherWallet founder and CEO Kosala Hemachandra. As the head of &nbsp;one of the most popular Ethereum interfaces, Kosala has a unique perspective on how the global pandemic has impacted activity. He also shared how coronavirus has disrupted his own life, and talks about what it’s like to run a company from his bedroom at his family’s home in Sri Lanka, on opposite timezones as the rest of his team. He also talks about how crypto was built for crises, about &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;importance of building a decentralized product —if it’s custodial, it’s not worth it— and what he believes the future of digital wallets will look like. Lastly, he told me about MEW’s next big projects: a DEX.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Decentralized Money Shouldn't be Traded on Centralized Exchanges: Loopring Founder Daniel Wang]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we talk with Daniel Wang, CEO and founder of the <a href="https://loopring.org/#/">Loopring</a> protocol. The exchange built on the protocol launched a little over a month ago, with the goal of providing a non-custodial platform, meaning it allows users to keep control of their funds, with similar performance in throughput and cost as centralized exchanges. There’s mind boggling technology with funny names behind this protocol —zero-knowledge proofs, Snarks, Starks,— which Wang demystifies and explains.</p>
<p>We talked about how scalability is a relative and not an absolute measure. To him that means Ethereum 2.0, an upgrade meant to increase the tractions per second on the network, won’t magically solve all scalability issues and Layer 2 solutions, which take part of applications’ data and computation off chain, will still be needed. To him though, users’ security is the wholly grail, and Ethereum is the best place to get it.</p>
<p>Wang also lamented lack of accessibility to Ethereum dapps and dexes in China, and talked about Loopring’s plans to launch a smart wallet geared for the Chinese market which will hopefully help solve this problem.</p>
<p>These are some of the key topics we discussed:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Loopring origins and having to give back most ICO funds<br>
</li>
 <li>The team’s decision to go all-in on zero-knowledge proofs<br>
</li>
  <li>The protocol’s tradeoffs: more centralization for faster and cheaper transactions<br>
</li>
  <li>Why users should use non-custodial exchanges instead of centralized trading platforms<br>
</li>
  <li>Lack of access to Ethereum dapps in China and smart wallets as the gateway to mass adoption<br>
</li>
  <li>Ethereum dapps scalability issues and Layer 2 solutions with Eth 2.0<br>
</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[MakerDAO Founder Rune Christensen On DeFi's Biggest Test Yet ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this week’s episode we speak with Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, the largest lending platform by assets in decentralized finance and the issuer of the Dai stablecoin. Rune has been in crypto since 2011 and is no stranger to volatility and crazy market conditions. Still, last month was the most shocking for him yet. On March 12th, MakerDAO’s mechanism to heal loans that become under-collateralized broke down amid the market crash, allowing one trader to run off with more than $4 million in free ether. He calls it Maker’s toughest test yet, and he believes the protocol passed it.</p>
<p>Key things we talked about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>MakerDAO’s plan to hand control to its community and dissolve the Maker Foundation<br>
</li>
 <li>MKR auction and token whales<br>
</li>
  <li>The decision to add centralized collateral to back Dai<br>
</li>
  <li>Whether Maker will add Bitcoin as collateral and create a euro-pegged Dai<br>
</li>
  <li>Collateral holders who lost 100% of their funds in the March 12 crash<br>
</li>
  <li>Rune’s long-term vision for DeFi and Maker, as an enabler for financial inclusion<br>
</li>
</ul>
