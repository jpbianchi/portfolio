The purpose is to use Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning to compare the accuracy and methodology of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model vs Word2vec for sentiment analysis.

It is typical NLP text classification: ie predict if a sentence has positive or negative sentiment. This notebook shows how to:

- Train a deep learning model in PyTorch/Pytorch Lightening
- Use pretrained features and foundation models
- Make predictions on new examples using a trained model
- Evaluating the performance of a trained model
- Compare the performance with using plain vanilla Word2vec

 ##### Main technologies used
 - BERT
 - Word2vec
 - Pytorch
 - Pytorch Lightening
